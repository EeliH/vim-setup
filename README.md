# vim-setup
My vim setup with automation

## Installation
1. ```git clone https://github.com/EeliH/vim-setup.git``` this directory to some nice place where you want to access it later.
2. Maybe rename the folder so it doesn't look stupid.
3. Remember to ```chmod +x install```
4. ```./install``` By the way, this could take some time.
5. ???
6. Profit.
